Tutorial: Understanding Different Agent Types in DataMCPServerAgent

This tutorial demonstrates the various agent architectures available in
DataMCPServerAgent, their capabilities, and when to use each type.

Learning objectives:
- Understand different agent architectures
- Learn the capabilities of each agent type
- Know when to use which agent
- See practical examples of each agent in action

Prerequisites:
- Completed 01_getting_started.py tutorial
- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- Environment variables configured
