# DataMCPServerAgent

A sophisticated Python-based agent system that combines context-aware memory, adaptive learning, and enhanced tool selection capabilities. Built on top of Bright Data's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

## Features

- **Context-Aware Memory**: Maintains and utilizes contextual information across interactions
- **Adaptive Learning**: Learns from user interactions and feedback to improve responses
- **Enhanced Tool Selection**: Sophisticated tool selection and performance tracking
- **Multi-Agent Learning**: Collaborative learning capabilities across multiple agent instances
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Continuous improvement through reward-based learning
- **Distributed Memory**: Scalable memory persistence across Redis and MongoDB backends with caching
- **Bright Data Integration**: Seamless integration with Bright Data's web unlocker and proxy services

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js (for Bright Data MCP)
- Bright Data MCP credentials
- Anthropic API key (for Claude model)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimaJoyti/DataMCPServerAgent.git
cd DataMCPServerAgent
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
python install_dependencies.py
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your credentials.

## Usage

Basic usage:

```python
from src.core.main import chat_with_agent

# Start the agent
asyncio.run(chat_with_agent())
```

For advanced features:

```python
from src.core.advanced_enhanced_main import chat_with_advanced_enhanced_agent

# Start the advanced enhanced agent
asyncio.run(chat_with_advanced_enhanced_agent())
```

For reinforcement learning:

```python
from src.core.reinforcement_learning_main import chat_with_rl_agent

# Start the reinforcement learning agent
asyncio.run(chat_with_rl_agent())
```

For distributed memory:

```python
from src.core.distributed_memory_main import chat_with_distributed_memory_agent

# Start the distributed memory agent
asyncio.run(chat_with_distributed_memory_agent())
```

See the `examples/` directory for more usage examples.
