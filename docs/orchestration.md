# Advanced Agent Orchestration System

The Advanced Agent Orchestration System is a sophisticated framework that integrates multiple AI reasoning paradigms into a cohesive, self-improving agent architecture. This system combines advanced reasoning, meta-reasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities to create agents that can handle complex, multi-step tasks with high autonomy and adaptability.

## Overview

The orchestration system consists of four main components:

1. **Advanced Reasoning Engine** - Multi-step reasoning with backtracking and causal analysis
2. **Meta-Reasoning Engine** - Reasoning about reasoning processes and strategy selection
3. **Advanced Planning Engine** - STRIPS-like planning with temporal and contingency planning
4. **Reflection Engine** - Self-evaluation and continuous learning mechanisms

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### OrchestrationCoordinator
The central coordinator that manages all subsystems and orchestrates their interactions.

```python
from src.core.orchestration_main import OrchestrationCoordinator

coordinator = OrchestrationCoordinator(model, tools, db)
response = await coordinator.process_request("Complex multi-step task")
```

#### Advanced Reasoning Engine
Implements sophisticated reasoning capabilities including:

- **Chain-of-Thought with Backtracking**: Can return to previous reasoning steps when errors are detected
- **Causal Reasoning**: Analyzes cause-effect relationships
- **Counterfactual Thinking**: Explores "what if" scenarios
- **Multi-perspective Analysis**: Considers problems from different viewpoints

```python
from src.agents.advanced_reasoning import AdvancedReasoningEngine

reasoning_engine = AdvancedReasoningEngine(model, db)
chain_id = await reasoning_engine.start_reasoning_chain(
    goal="Analyze market trends",
    initial_context={"domain": "technology", "timeframe": "2024"}
)
```

#### Meta-Reasoning Engine
Provides meta-cognitive capabilities:

- **Strategy Selection**: Chooses optimal reasoning strategies for different problem types
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitors reasoning performance
- **Error Detection**: Identifies logical errors and inconsistencies
- **Strategy Adaptation**: Adapts strategies based on performance feedback

```python
from src.agents.meta_reasoning import MetaReasoningEngine

meta_engine = MetaReasoningEngine(model, db, reasoning_engine)
strategy = await meta_engine.select_reasoning_strategy(
    problem="Complex analysis task",
    problem_type="analytical",
    confidence_requirement=0.8
)
```

#### Advanced Planning Engine
Implements multiple planning paradigms:

- **STRIPS Planning**: Classical AI planning with preconditions and effects
- **Temporal Planning**: Planning with time constraints and durations
- **Contingency Planning**: Robust planning that handles uncertainty
- **Hierarchical Task Networks**: Decomposition of complex tasks

```python
from src.agents.advanced_planning import AdvancedPlanningEngine

planning_engine = AdvancedPlanningEngine(model, db)
plan = await planning_engine.create_strips_plan(
    goal="Complete research project",
    initial_state={"resources_available", "topic_defined"},
    goal_conditions=[Condition("project_completed", ["research"])]
)
```

#### Reflection Engine
Provides self-evaluation and learning capabilities:

- **Performance Reflection**: Analyzes recent performance and outcomes
- **Strategy Reflection**: Evaluates effectiveness of reasoning strategies
- **Error Reflection**: Deep analysis of errors and failures for learning
- **Learning Reflection**: Monitors knowledge acquisition and skill development

```python
from src.agents.reflection_systems import AdvancedReflectionEngine

reflection_engine = AdvancedReflectionEngine(model, db)
session = await reflection_engine.trigger_reflection(
    trigger_event="Task completion",
    focus_areas=["performance", "strategy", "learning"]
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Orchestration

```python
import asyncio
from src.core.orchestration_main import chat_with_orchestrated_agent

# Start the orchestrated agent system
asyncio.run(chat_with_orchestrated_agent())
```

### Custom Orchestration

```python
from src.core.orchestration_main import OrchestrationCoordinator
from src.memory.memory_persistence import MemoryDatabase
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

# Initialize components
model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
db = MemoryDatabase("my_agent.db")
tools = []  # Your tools here

# Create coordinator
coordinator = OrchestrationCoordinator(model, tools, db)

# Process requests
response = await coordinator.process_request(
    "Analyze the competitive landscape for AI startups and create a strategic plan"
)
```

### Advanced Features

#### Strategy Selection
```python
# Get strategy recommendation for a specific problem
strategy_rec = await coordinator.meta_reasoning_engine.select_reasoning_strategy(
    problem="Multi-criteria decision making",
    problem_type="decision_analysis",
    time_constraint=300,  # 5 minutes
    confidence_requirement=0.85
)

print(f"Recommended strategy: {strategy_rec['recommended_strategy']}")
print(f"Expected effectiveness: {strategy_rec['expected_effectiveness']}%")
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Monitor reasoning performance
if coordinator.reasoning_engine.active_chains:
    chain_id = list(coordinator.reasoning_engine.active_chains.keys())[0]
    chain = coordinator.reasoning_engine.active_chains[chain_id]
    
    performance = await coordinator.meta_reasoning_engine.monitor_performance(chain)
    print(f"Performance score: {performance['performance_score']}")
    print(f"Identified issues: {performance['identified_issues']}")
```

#### Reflection Triggers
```python
# Trigger reflection on specific events
reflection_session = await coordinator.reflection_engine.trigger_reflection(
    trigger_event="Complex task completed",
    focus_areas=["performance", "strategy", "errors", "learning"]
)

print(f"Generated {len(reflection_session.insights)} insights")
for insight in reflection_session.insights:
    print(f"- {insight.reflection_type.value}: {insight.content[:100]}...")
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
BRIGHT_DATA_API_TOKEN=your_bright_data_token  # Optional
```

### Database Configuration
The system uses SQLite for persistence by default:

```python
# Custom database path
db = MemoryDatabase("custom_path/agent_memory.db")

# The database automatically creates tables for:
# - Reasoning chains and steps
# - Plans and execution history
# - Meta-reasoning decisions
# - Reflection sessions and insights
```

### Model Configuration
```python
model = ChatAnthropic(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    temperature=0.1,  # Lower temperature for more consistent reasoning
    max_tokens=4000,
    api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
)
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

The orchestration system is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing DataMCPServerAgent components:

### With Enhanced Agent Architecture
```python
from src.agents.enhanced_agent_architecture import EnhancedCoordinatorAgent

# The orchestration system can work alongside existing enhanced agents
enhanced_agent = EnhancedCoordinatorAgent(model, sub_agents, db, tool_selector)
```

### With Reinforcement Learning
```python
from src.agents.reinforcement_learning import RLCoordinatorAgent

# Combine with RL-based decision making
rl_agent = RLCoordinatorAgent(model, sub_agents, db, rl_agent_type="q_learning")
```

### With Multi-Agent Learning
```python
from src.agents.multi_agent_learning import MultiAgentLearningSystem

# Integrate with collaborative learning systems
learning_system = MultiAgentLearningSystem(model, db, agents)
```

## Performance Optimization

## Monitoring and Debugging

### System Statistics
```python
# Get orchestration statistics
stats = {
    "requests_processed": len(coordinator.orchestration_history),
    "active_reasoning_chains": len(coordinator.active_reasoning_chains),
    "active_plans": len(coordinator.active_plans),
    "meta_decisions": len(coordinator.meta_reasoning_engine.meta_decisions),
    "reflection_sessions": len(coordinator.reflection_engine.reflection_sessions)
}
```

### Cognitive State Monitoring
```python
# Monitor cognitive state
cognitive_state = coordinator.meta_reasoning_engine.cognitive_state
print(f"Confidence: {cognitive_state.confidence_level}")
print(f"Cognitive load: {cognitive_state.cognitive_load}")
print(f"Error rate: {cognitive_state.error_rate}")
```

### Performance Metrics
```python
# Analyze performance trends
for history_item in coordinator.orchestration_history[-10:]:
    print(f"Strategy: {history_item['strategy']}")
    print(f"Duration: {history_item['duration']:.2f}s")
    print(f"Success: {history_item['result']['confidence'] > 0.7}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic orchestration and gradually enable advanced features
2. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check cognitive state and performance metrics
3. **Tune Thresholds**: Adjust confidence and performance thresholds based on your use case
4. **Use Reflection**: Leverage reflection insights to improve system performance
