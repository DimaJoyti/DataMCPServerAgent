## FUN-44: Implement Advanced Error Analysis Techniques

### Changes

- Implemented error clustering using TF-IDF vectorization and DBSCAN algorithm
- Added root cause analysis to identify underlying causes of errors
- Created error correlation analysis to detect relationships between different errors
- Implemented predictive error detection to anticipate potential future errors
- Added comprehensive analysis that combines all analysis techniques
- Updated documentation with advanced error analysis information
- Added example script demonstrating the advanced error analysis capabilities
- Added scikit-learn dependency for machine learning-based error analysis

### Files Added

- `src/utils/advanced_error_analysis.py`: Advanced error analysis system with clustering, root cause analysis, correlation analysis, and predictive detection
- `examples/advanced_error_analysis_example.py`: Example demonstrating the advanced error analysis capabilities
- `docs/advanced_error_analysis.md`: Detailed documentation for the advanced error analysis system
- `docs/FUN-44_COMMIT_MESSAGE.md`: Commit message for FUN-44

### Files Modified

- `requirements.txt`: Added scikit-learn dependency
- `README.md`: Updated with information about the advanced error analysis capabilities

### Testing

The advanced error analysis system has been tested with the example script and works as expected. It successfully:

- Clusters similar errors based on patterns
- Identifies root causes of errors
- Detects correlations between different errors
- Predicts potential future errors
- Provides comprehensive analysis results

### Next Steps

- Integrate advanced error analysis with reinforcement learning for improved decision-making
- Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques for error message understanding
- Add real-time error prediction and prevention
- Create automated error recovery strategy selection based on analysis
