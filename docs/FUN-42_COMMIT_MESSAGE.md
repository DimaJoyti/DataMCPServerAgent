## FUN-42: Enhance Error Recovery

### Changes

- Implemented sophisticated retry strategies with different backoff algorithms
- Added automatic fallback to alternative tools based on error analysis
- Created a self-healing system that learns from errors and improves over time
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
- Added error analysis capabilities to determine the most appropriate recovery strategy
- Created an error recovery agent that integrates with the existing agent architecture
- Added comprehensive documentation for the error recovery system

### Files Added

- `src/utils/error_recovery.py`: Advanced error recovery system with retry strategies, fallbacks, and self-healing
- `src/core/error_recovery_main.py`: Main entry point for the error recovery agent
- `tests/test_error_recovery.py`: Tests for the error recovery system
- `examples/enhanced_error_recovery_example.py`: Example demonstrating the error recovery capabilities
- `docs/error_recovery.md`: Detailed documentation for the error recovery system
- `docs/FUN-42_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md`: Completion checklist for FUN-42
- `docs/FUN-42_COMMIT_MESSAGE.md`: Commit message for FUN-42

### Files Modified

- `main.py`: Updated to include the error recovery agent
- `README.md`: Updated with information about the error recovery capabilities

### Testing

The error recovery system has been tested with the example script and works as expected. It successfully:

- Retries operations with different backoff strategies
- Falls back to alternative tools when a primary tool fails
- Learns from errors to improve future recovery
- Prevents cascading failures with the circuit breaker pattern

### Next Steps

- Consider implementing more advanced error analysis techniques
- Explore integration with reinforcement learning for improved decision-making
- Investigate distributed circuit breakers for multi-agent systems
- Consider adding more sophisticated fallback selection algorithms
