The A/B testing framework (`src/utils/rl_ab_testing.py`) enables comparison of different reinforcement learning strategies:

#### RLStrategyVariant

The `RLStrategyVariant` class represents a variant of a reinforcement learning strategy:

- Tracks performance metrics for the variant
- Processes requests using the variant's agent
- Provides performance summaries

Key features:

## Comparison of Approaches

### Basic RL vs. Advanced RL

Basic RL (Q-learning, Policy Gradient) is well-suited for:
- Discrete state spaces
- Simpler problems
- Limited computational resources

Advanced RL (Deep RL) is better for:
- Continuous state spaces
- Complex problems
- Rich feature representations

### Single-Objective vs. Multi-Objective RL

Single-objective RL is appropriate when:
- There is a clear, single optimization goal
- Objectives are highly correlated
- Simplicity is preferred

Multi-objective RL is better when:
- Multiple competing objectives exist
- Objectives may conflict with each other
- Transparency in trade-offs is important

## Future Directions

Potential future enhancements to the advanced reinforcement learning system:

1. **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**: Implement hierarchical RL for handling complex, multi-step tasks
2. **Meta-Learning**: Add meta-learning capabilities for faster adaptation to new tasks
3. **Distributed Learning**: Support distributed learning across multiple agents
4. **Explainable AI Enhancements**: Further improve the explainability of RL-based decisions
5. **Integration with External RL Frameworks**: Add support for integration with external RL frameworks like Ray RLlib
