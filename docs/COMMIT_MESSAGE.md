## FUN-41: Implement Advanced Agent Architectures

### Changes

- Implemented context-aware memory with intelligent retrieval based on context
- Added adaptive learning system that adapts to user preferences
- Created user preference modeling for personalized responses
- Implemented working memory for maintaining context during conversations
- Added learning strategy development for continuous improvement
- Fixed async/await handling in memory persistence and context-aware memory
- Added proper error handling for missing dependencies
- Created detailed documentation for the advanced enhanced agent
- Added installation script for dependencies
- Updated requirements.txt with new dependencies

### Files Added

- `context_aware_memory.py`: Context-aware memory retrieval and management
- `adaptive_learning.py`: Adaptive learning and user preference modeling
- `advanced_enhanced_main.py`: Main entry point for the advanced enhanced agent
- `examples/advanced_enhanced_example.py`: Example script demonstrating the advanced capabilities
- `install_dependencies.py`: Script to install required dependencies
- `ADVANCED_AGENT_README.md`: Detailed documentation for the advanced enhanced agent

### Files Modified

- `memory_persistence.py`: Added missing methods and async support
- `requirements.txt`: Added new dependencies
- `README.md`: Updated with information about the advanced enhanced agent

### Testing

The advanced enhanced agent has been tested with the example script and works as expected. It successfully:

- Retrieves relevant information based on context
- Adapts to user preferences
- Learns from feedback
- Maintains context during conversations
- Develops learning strategies for continuous improvement

### Next Steps

- Consider implementing distributed memory for scalability
- Explore multi-agent learning for improved performance
- Investigate reinforcement learning for continuous improvement
- Consider knowledge graph integration for better context understanding
